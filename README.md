# Snapnow - Social App with Encrypted Messages
SnapNow combines the best features of Snapchat and BeReal while prioritizing user privacy and security.

One of the standout features of this app is its robust messages encryption that are stored directly on the client devices. If the client is not connected to the internet, messages will be temporarly and securely stored in a database until the client reconnects.

Last but not least SnapNow also introduce a dynamic storytelling feature. To post a story the user must wait for the notification that allows him to do so. This notification will appear at a random time in the day and will only let the user post in the next 10 minutes.
